              Minecraft's new frogs were briefly swallowing goats whole

            As part of the experimental features in Minecraft Bedrock version
            1.18.10, Mojang has revealed some of the abilities of the frog mobs
            coming in this year's Wild Update. They can eat small Slimes and
            small Magma Cubes, which is a goofy enough habit. As Mojang shared
            during today's Minecraft Live presentation, frogs had a brief period
            as apex predators capable of swallowing entire goats. Players
            started noticing this savage frog behavior in the beta version of
            Minecraft for Windows back in January. Their hunger was, as some
            players realized, insatiable.
